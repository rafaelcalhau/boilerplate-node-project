Boilerplate application for Node.js with express, typescript, sucrase, mongoose, authenticated REST API, and implementing security best practices.

## Security best practices

1. **Embracing linter security rules**: [eslint-plugin-security](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security) - This project helps to identify potential security hotspots.
2. **Disable the header X-Powered-By**: Your application won't show that was developed using Express.js, preventing to send this info to attackers.
